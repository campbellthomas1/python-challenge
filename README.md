# Python-Challenge

## PyPoll
In this challenge I organized data from an election to figure out:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

## PyBank
In this challenge I took budget data and figured out:

- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
